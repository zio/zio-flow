/**
 * 1. Get all policies that will expire in the next 60 days.
 * 2. For each of these policies, do the following -
 * 2.1 Make multiple calls to internal/external services to evaluate if the buyer's risk has changed.
 * This determination is based on a bunch of different params -
 * 2.1.1 Have they claimed the policy in the past year?
 * 2.1.2 External (possibly flaky) service call to assess fire-risk of the property (based on address).
 * 2.1.3 Is manual evaluation required here? {based on the params from above service calls}
 * 2.1.3.1 If manual evaluation is required, send reminder email to staff. They can set a variable once manual evaluation is completed.
 * Otherwise, send email reminders every 2 days
 * 2.2 Calculate - how many days to 45 days before policy renewal. And sleep till that period.
 * 2.3 Check if the policy renewal is offered or not (function call) along with the terms of the new policy.
 * 2.4 When there are 45 days remaining, send an email to the buyer offering renewal of policy. They can respond with `Renew/ Do not Renew`.
 * A variable is set when they respond.
 * 2.4 Send reminder emails every 2 days until the customer responds or time elapses
 * 2.5 If the client wants to renew the policy, call payment service to deduct payment for this PolicyBuyer.
 * Retry for 30 days or until it succeeds.
