ZIO Flow is an engine for executing persistent, distributed, fault-tolerant applications, providing an easy and powerful way to build stateful serverless applications.

- Type-safe, compositional front-end
- Resilient interactions with databases, web services, and microservices
- Persistent workflows that survive restarts
- Transactional guarantees via a persistent saga pattern

ZIO Flow helps you orchestrate complex business logic, without having to worry about fallible systems, transient failures, manual rollbacks, or other infrastructure.
